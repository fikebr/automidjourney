# Automate Midjourney

A system that automates can take my prompts that I set up on a google sheet and runs them for me.

## Todo

1. implement a "big sleep" feature and a mouse twitch so that I can run this script like a service and it will stop the screensaver from starting. the "big sleep" could also be a "start time" instead of a number of seconds.
2. implement a system for suffix and prefix in the google sheet
3. add a bigger sleep after every X prompts. (that )
4. is there a world where i can monetize this system?
